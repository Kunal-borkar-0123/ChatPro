# ChatPro
<h1 align="center"><b>🕹Chat_Pro<br>The Real-Time Chatting App
 </b></h1>
A simple socket based GUI real-time chatting application built on client-server model in Python 2.7! 

# Usage
1. Launch with the following command and select mode (Server/Client)

    > `python chatpro.py`

    or do the following if you're on linux

    > `chmod +x chatpro.py`

    > `./chatpro.py`

2. To connect a client to a server, select Client mode and enter the IP address of the server and a nick name.
3. Select a receiver from a list of connected clients and chat away!

# TODO
1. Add error handling (connections error, could not connect to server etc.)
2. Make the app more robust (retry on connection drops etc.)
3. Add a tab based chat system (a tab for each chat)
